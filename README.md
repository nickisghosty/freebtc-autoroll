# Freebitco.in auto-roll
This addon checks to see if freebitco.in is open or not, if not creates a new tab and makes sure there is always at least one tab of freebitco.in open for the add on to work.
(only while browser is open)

It also waits for the free play button to become available and automatically clicks it. (as long as you don't need to fill out the captcha)

Then checks if you have any RP bonus active, and if you have enough RP auto claims the highest bonus accordingly.
