# Freebitco.in auto-roll
This addon checks to see if freebitco.in is open or not, if not creates a new tab and makes sure there is always at least one tab of freebitco.in open for the add on to work.
(only while browser is open)

It also waits for the free play button to become available and automatically clicks it. (as long as you don't need to fill out the captcha)

Then checks if you have any RP bonus active, and if you have enough RP auto claims the highest bonus accordingly.

# Install

[Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/freebitcoin-automated/mmmidhlgmjehopdjiinffadldiopmfck) 

[Firefox](https://github.com/nickisghosty/freebtc-autoroll/releases/download/3.6.2/auto_freebitcoin_nickisghosty-3.6.2-fx.xpi) to install you need to download the signed XPI release and drag and drop to your firefox browser window.(Or just click the firefox link from the firefox browser) Then the add extension pop up window will appear where you'll need to click add. You may thank Mozilla for considering this addon to go against their acceptable use policy for supporting "illegal gambiling". Even though it had been on their add on gallery for a couple years, and just this week they decided  it went against their rules. Must be because of the updates I've been doing.

[Chrome](https://github.com/nickisghosty/freebtc-autoroll/releases/download/3.6.2/freebtc-autoroll.-.Copy.crx) you must install via source by downloading the zip and going to [about:extensions](chrome://about:extensions). Then make sure "Development mode" is on. Finally click the load unpacked extension and find the source file you just downloaded. You may thank Google for their developers fee in order to post to their extension store.

# Usage
Install and make sure the control is on in the pop up extension settings.
