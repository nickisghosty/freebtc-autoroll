<h1 align="center"> Freebitco.in auto-roll - NickisGhosty </h1><hr />
This addon checks to see if freebitco.in is open or not, if not creates a new tab and makes sure there is always at least one tab of freebitco.in open for the add on to work.
(only while browser is open)

It also waits for the free play button to become available and automatically clicks it after a set amount of time, either random or after the value in the settings. If it requires you to fill out a captcha, it will click the play without captcha button for you. If you don't have enough RP you'll need to turn the extension off and mannually do the captcha. (This extension wont be much help for you) 

Then checks if you have any RP bonuses active, and if you have enough RP auto claims the highest bonus for the set bonuses to claim.

<h2>INSTALL</h2>5
[Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/freebitcoin-automated/mmmidhlgmjehopdjiinffadldiopmfck) 

[Firefox](https://github.com/nickisghosty/freebtc-autoroll/releases/download/latest/freebtc-autoroll-nickisghosty.xpi) to install if clicking this link doesnt work, you may need to download the signed XPI release and drag and drop to your firefox browser window. Then the add extension pop up window will appear where you'll need to click add. (You may thank Mozilla for considering this addon to go against their acceptable use policy for supporting "illegal gambiling". Even though it had been on their add on gallery for a couple years, and just this week they decided  it went against their rules. Must be because of the updates I've been doing.)

[Chrome](https://github.com/nickisghosty/freebtc-autoroll/releases/download/latest/freebtc-autoroll-nickisghosty.crx) if clicking this link doesnt work, you must install via source by downloading the zip and going to [about:extensions](chrome://about:extensions). Then make sure "Development mode" is on. Finally click the load unpacked extension and find the source file you just downloaded.( You may thank Google for their developers fee in order to post to their extension store.)

<h4> UPDATE</h4>
Completely rewrote the code and updated the UI to include setting the extension on and off as well as which bonuses to claim and a selectable delay before clicking the free play "play with no captcha" / "Free Roll" button. Added tabs to the UI for a future feature that will auto bet in the "Multiply BTC" game. As well as an about tab that links to here and gives my email for contact and a BTC address for if anyone feels generous and wants to donate. (: Enjoy.
